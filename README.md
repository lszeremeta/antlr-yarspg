The YARS-PG serialization is a special version of [YARS](https://github.com/lszeremeta/yars) for property graphs.

The YARS-PG grammar is written in [ANTLR4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4). If you prefer [Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-notation) notation, you can also see preview version of [YARS-PG grammar in EBNF](https://github.com/lszeremeta/antlr-yarspg/blob/master/other-notations/YARSpg.ebnf).

This project based on [ANTLR grammars-v4 project](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4).

## Testing grammar

Run tests on files in ``yarspg/examples``:

```shell
mvn clean test
```
